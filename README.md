A demonstration project showing how to build applications compatible with the OpenAI API specification, supporting both native OpenAI API and compatible API services.

## ‚ú® Features

- Support for OpenAI API and compatible API services
- Asynchronous API calls
- Interactive chat interface
- Chat history management
- Configurable logging system
- Type hints and documentation
- Error handling and retries

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/openai_compatiable_demo.git
cd openai_compatiable_demo
```

2. Create and activate Python virtual environment using uv:
```bash
# Create virtual environment
uv venv .venv --python=3.12

# Activate virtual environment
# Unix/macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
# First install build tools
uv pip install hatchling

# Install package in editable mode
uv pip install -e .
```

If you encounter any issues during installation, please ensure:
- Python 3.12 or higher is installed
- uv is properly installed and added to system PATH
- Virtual environment is activated before running installation commands

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1. Copy the example configuration file:
```bash
cp config.toml.example config.toml
```

2. Edit `config.toml` to set your API configuration:
```toml
[api.openai]
api_key = "your-openai-api-key"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
temperature = 0.7
max_tokens = 2000
timeout = 30
stream = false
retry_count = 3
retry_delay = 1

[logging]
level = "INFO"
format = "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
file = "app.log"
max_size = 10485760  # 10MB
backup_count = 5
```

### üìù Configuration Details

#### üîë API Configuration
- `api_key`: Your OpenAI API key
- `base_url`: API endpoint URL
- `model`: Model name to use
- `temperature`: Controls randomness (0.0 to 1.0)
- `max_tokens`: Maximum tokens to generate
- `timeout`: Request timeout in seconds
- `stream`: Enable streaming responses
- `retry_count`: Number of retries for failed requests
- `retry_delay`: Delay between retries in seconds

#### üìä Logging Configuration
- `level`: Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- `format`: Log message format
- `file`: Log file path
- `max_size`: Maximum size of log file in bytes
- `backup_count`: Number of backup log files to keep

## üí¨ Usage

### Interactive Chat
